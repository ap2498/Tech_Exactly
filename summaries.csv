"Based on the provided document, it appears to be a dataset containing salary information for various years of experience. The data points range from 1.1 years of experience to 10.5 years of experience, along with the corresponding salaries.

Here's a summary of the dataset:

- The data suggests a non-linear relationship between years of experience and salary. The salary increases significantly with a small amount of experience, but then levels off or even decreases slightly for some periods.
- The data points from 1.1 to 3.2 years of experience show a relatively consistent increase in salary, with a slight dip at 1.5 years of experience.
- Between 3.2 and 4.0 years of experience, the salary decreases, but then increases again.
- From 4.0 to 6.0 years of experience, the salary continues to increase, with a slight dip at 5.1 years of experience.
- The data points from 6.0 to 10.5 years of experience show a significant increase in salary, with a few fluctuations.

Here are some key observations:

- The highest salary is $113,812, corresponding to 8.2 years of experience.
- The lowest salary is $35,943, corresponding to 1.1 years of experience.
- The average salary for the entire dataset is around $75,000, although this number can be misleading due to the non-linear relationship between experience and salary.

Overall, the data suggests that salary increases significantly with experience, but the relationship is not linear.",Salary_Data.csv,/Users/adityapaul2498/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Coding/tech_exactly_assignment/downloads/Salary_Data.csv
