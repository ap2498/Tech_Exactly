"Based on the provided data, it appears to be a list of salaries corresponding to different years of experience. Here's a summary of the data:

- The data spans from 1.1 years of experience to 10.5 years of experience.
- The salary ranges from $39,343 to $1,219,872.
- The salary generally increases with the years of experience.
- There are a few instances where the salary appears to decrease with experience, but these are outliers in an otherwise upward trend.
- The average annual increase in salary is not constant, but it does seem to increase as the years of experience increase.
- The data suggests that there are significant salary jumps around 5-6 years of experience and again around 8-9 years of experience.

If we need to find the relationship between years of experience and salary, we can try to find a curve fit for the data. However, based solely on the provided data, we can observe the general trend of increasing salary with experience.",Salary_Data.csv,/Users/adityapaul2498/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Coding/tech_exactly_assignment/downloads/Salary_Data.csv,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZm2sf2gze8F5PN4JWqIcnxyRO-1Vh8q/view?usp=drivesdk
