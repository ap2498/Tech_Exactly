"Based on the provided data, it appears to be a regression analysis or a data set containing salary information in relation to years of experience. Here's a summary of the data:

- The data set contains salary information for individuals with varying years of experience, ranging from 1.1 to 10.5 years.
- The average salary per year of experience from 1 to 10 years is not a simple linear calculation due to the nature of the data set, but if we look at the highest and lowest salaries provided for each range, we can derive a general pattern.

Here's a possible pattern:

- Less than 2 years of experience: The lowest salary provided is $38,943, and the highest salary provided is $46,205. This suggests a salary range of around $7,262.
- 2 to 4 years of experience: The lowest salary provided is $34,825, and the highest salary provided is $63,218. This suggests a salary range of around $28,393.
- 4 to 8 years of experience: The lowest salary provided is $55,794, and the highest salary provided is $114,812. This suggests a salary range of around $59,018.
- 8 to 10 years of experience: The lowest salary provided is $109,431, and the highest salary provided is $122,391. This suggests a salary range of around $12,960.

It appears that salaries generally increase with years of experience, but the rate of increase may not be linear.",Salary_Data.csv,/Users/adityapaul2498/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Coding/tech_exactly_assignment/downloads/Salary_Data.csv,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZm2sf2gze8F5PN4JWqIcnxyRO-1Vh8q/view?usp=drivesdk
